### What I learned

A lot about JavaScript, much of it by feeling my way through the code and trying ideas out.


### Continued development

Focusing on JS, while keeping up the HTML and CSS skills I have. 


### Useful resources

I started with this tutorial for star rating: https://dev.to/leonardoschmittk/how-to-make-a-star-rating-with-js-36d3 and worked my way from there.
